#### Snippets :
You can simply download the files and put them in your vault, in the "snippets" folder (you must create him if you never use a snippet) which is in the .obsidian folder. 
After that, go to Obsidian > Settings > Apparence and at the bottom of the page, click on recharge snippets and the snippet will appear !

You must download the whole folder with the chosen plugin. After that, go in the "plugins" folder (you must create him if you never use a plugin) which is in the .obsidian folder.
